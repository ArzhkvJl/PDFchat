# PDFchat
Project in chat.py analyses pdf files and gives answers about them
It has pretty UI:

To use it we have to upload model lama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf from https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/tree/main and add it to ./models directory


Another project in fine-tunning.py demonstrates an example of retraining the large language model llama2 on a third-party dataset
